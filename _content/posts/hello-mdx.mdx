# Welcome to MDX!

This is a test post to verify our MDX implementation. Let's try out different features:

## 1. Basic Markdown

Here's some **bold text** and *italic text*.

> This is a blockquote that should be styled nicely.

## 2. Lists and Code

Here's a list:
- First item
- Second item
- Third item with `inline code`

```javascript
// Code block with syntax highlighting
const greeting = "Hello, MDX!";
console.log(greeting);
```

## 3. Images

Regular markdown image:

Using Next.js Image component in a container:
<div className="relative w-full aspect-video">
  <Image 
    src="/images/sample-image.jpg"
    alt="Sample image with aspect ratio container"
    fill
    className="object-cover"
  />
</div>

## 4. Links

Here's a table:

## 7. Custom Components

You can now use React components directly in your MDX files:

<CustomBox>
  <p className="text-lg font-bold">This is a custom styled box</p>
  <p>With multiple paragraphs and styling!</p>
</CustomBox>
