![Peggy Idea](/images/peggy_idea.jpg)

Watching the premiere of _Mad Men_ season six, I _loved_ that Peggy Olson blasted her creative team for bringing her three variations on the same idea. These are words to remember.

> Those are three different versions of the same idea.
> 
> If you can't tell the difference between which part's the idea and which part's the execution of the idea, you're of no use to me.
> 
> â€¦Well I'm sorry to point it out, but you're walking over the same ground. When you bring me something like this, it looks like cowardice.
